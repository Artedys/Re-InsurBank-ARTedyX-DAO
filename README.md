# Re-InsurBank-ARTedyX-DAO
Democratizing Access for  small equity holders to DEX and CEX CAT bond to Catastrophe Bonds Traditionally Exclusive to Institutional Buyers. 

# 1/ Without satellites data

Language > Specialist: MLT (Mintlayer Token) > Smart Contract Developer
Includes: MLT, Smart Contracts, DeFi protocols, Token Standards
Requirements: V=2, emphasis on modularity, security, and gas efficiency

## Plan
1. Understand the requirements for a catastrophe bond on the Mintlayer protocol.
2. Define the structure and components of the smart contract, including the bond issuance, premium payments, and payout conditions.
3. Implement the smart contract using MLT.
4. Ensure compliance with security best practices and Mintlayer standards.
5. Test the contract for functionality and security.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Bond Issuance:
   - Define the parameters for issuing a catastrophe bond, such as bond amount, premium rate, and maturity date.

2. Premium Payments:
   - Implement the mechanism for regular premium payments from the issuer to the investors.

3. Payout Conditions:
   - Define the conditions under which the bond will pay out, such as the occurrence of a predefined catastrophe event.

4. Redemption and Maturity:
   - Handle the redemption of the bond at maturity if no catastrophe event has occurred.

    function redeemBond() public {
        require(block.timestamp >= maturityDate, "Bond has not matured yet");
        require(!bondRedeemed, "Bond already redeemed");
        
        if (catastropheOccurred) {
            // Payout to investor
            payable(investor).transfer(bondAmount);
        } else {
            // Refund to issuer
            payable(issuer).transfer(bondAmount);
        }
        bondRedeemed = true;
    }
}
```

# Next Steps
1. Deploy and Test:
   - Deploy the contract on a Mintlayer testnet.
   - Test all functions for correct behavior and security vulnerabilities.

2. Security Review:
   - Conduct a thorough security review to identify and mitigate potential risks.

3. Documentation:
   - Document the contract and provide usage instructions for issuers and investors.

4. Integration:
   - Integrate the contract with relevant Mintlayer ecosystem tools and platforms.

# Next Task: Deploy and test the contract on Mintlayer testnet. Conduct a security review and document the contract. Integrate with Mintlayer tools and platforms.

# 2/ With satellites data

Language > Specialist: MLT (Mintlayer Token) > Smart Contract Developer
Includes: MLT, Smart Contracts, DeFi protocols, Token Standards, Oracles, External Data Integration
Requirements: V=2, emphasis on modularity, security, and gas efficiency

## Plan
1. Understand the requirements for integrating external data (KPI from satellites) into the catastrophe bond contract.
2. Define the structure and components of the smart contract, including the bond issuance, premium payments, and payout conditions.
3. Implement the contract using an oracle to fetch KPI data.
4. Ensure compliance with security best practices and Mintlayer standards.
5. Test the contract for functionality and security.

# Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Bond Issuance:
   - Define the parameters for issuing a catastrophe bond, such as bond amount, premium rate, and maturity date.

2. Premium Payments:
   - Implement the mechanism for regular premium payments from the issuer to the investors.

3. Payout Conditions:
   - Define the conditions under which the bond will pay out based on the KPI data fetched from an external oracle.

4. Oracle Integration:
   - Integrate an oracle to fetch satellite data for KPIs (e.g., forest fires).

5. Redemption and Maturity:
   - Handle the redemption of the bond at maturity if no catastrophe event has occurred based on the KPI data.

# Next Steps
1. Deploy and Test:

   - Test all functions, especially the integration with the oracle, for correct behavior and security vulnerabilities.

2. Security Review:
   - Conduct a thorough security review to identify and mitigate potential risks, focusing on oracle manipulation and data integrity.

3. Documentation:
   - Document the contract and provide usage instructions for issuers and investors, including how to set up and interact with the oracle.

4. Integration:
   - Integrate the contract with relevant Mintlayer ecosystem tools and platforms and ensure seamless interaction with the oracle service.
